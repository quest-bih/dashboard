    interestingly the levels of all eight proteins (100%) were significantly higher in diabetic zsf1 rats (data s1) again underscoring the similarities of the zsf1 rat model to human dkd.;     after cluster-specific differential gene-expression analysis (figure s2f data s2) we grouped clusters into coarse-grained high-level cell types: podocytes (podo) endothelial cells (endo) stroma cells (stroma) proximal tubule cells (prox tub pt) non-proximal tubule cells (non-prox tub) such as loop of henle (loh) distal convoluted tubule (dct) connecting tubule (cnt) collecting duct principal cells (pc) and collecting duct intercalated cells (ic) as well as immune cells (immune) (figures 2a and 2c).;     pt and stromal cells showed the highest number of degs between treatment groups (figures s4a–s4c; data s3 s4 and s5).;     <section> as the disease state was associated with important differences in both cell fractions and cell-type-specific gene expression we used tensor decomposition analysis on our singlenuclei dataset (figure 2e; data s6 s7 and s8) for an unbiased determination of critically important cell types associated with phenotypic changes.;     based on the high expression of their cluster-specific degs (figure 3b and data s9) we annotated them as proximal convoluted tubule (pct slc5a2) proximal straight tubule s2 segment (pst s2 zmat4 slc25a25) and proximal straight tubule (pst slc1a1) which represented healthy pt cells with typical marker gene expression.;     <section> next we analyzed the number of degs ‘‘normalized’’ (their expression changed to healthy level) by sgcact and sgcstim treatment (data s10 s11 and s12).;     unbiased clustering revealed two mesangial cell clusters (mesang itga8 gata3); juxtaglomerular apparatus (jga ren); multiple fibroblast (fib) clusters with previously described marker genes such as mgp apoe b2m serpine1 pdgfra cxcl10 igfbp3 xkr4 igfbp5 or with an immune cell signature (immune fib ikzf1 ptprc); clusters with pt marker genes (pt1 pt2); glomerular endothelial cells (gec flt1 ptprb); myofibroblasts (myofib tnfrsf11b acta2); vascular smooth muscle cells (vsmc col14a1 ntrk3); a mixture of the latter two (vsmc/myofib ntrk3 myh11 synpo2); and pericytes (peri rgs5 notch3) (figures 3e–3g and data s13).;     degs specifically higher along this trajectory (data s14) enriched for typical pt functions such as organic anion transport small molecule and amino acid metabolism at the start of the lineage (pst) toward pathways associated with adherens junctions extracellular matrix (ecm)-receptor interaction focal adhesion and epithelial-tomesenchymal transition (emt) at the end of the lineage (profibpt) (figures 4c and 4d; data s15).;     the second trajectory followed a path from profibpt enriching for tight junction tgfb signaling and adherens junction signaling via a second ptinj cluster and dediffpt toward int and mesench enriched e.g. for emt cell adhesion collagen fibril organization and wound healing (figures 4b–4d and data s15).;     these two subgroups showed a large number of non-overlapping i.e. individually unique degs (figure 4f and data s16) indicating separate transcriptomic states.;     this was validated by clear separation of go terms enriched in ptinj_1 and ptinj_2 respectively in latent semantic space (figure s9q and data s17).;     for example we found highly specific regulons for pst (gcm1 stat5a bcl6 lmx1b trps1) profibpt (tead2 bach2 stat3 gli3 fosl2) and mesench (gli2 gata6 fli1 tcf7l2 hoxc6) (figures 6d s12c and s12d; data s18).;     we first created a wgcnacompatible metanuclei dataset (figure 7a and star methods) from which we retrieved seven gene modules (figures 7b and s13a; data s19).;     module-specific phenotypes were consistent with kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (kegg) pathway and go term analysis suggesting pathway enrichment representing healthy pt function in the turquoise model profibrotic processes in blue yellow and black models dedifferentiation to non-proximal tubule in the brown model and ecm/mesench processes in green and red modules respectively (figure s14a and data s20).;     we asked whether we could leverage this unbiased orthogonal dataset to a group with microdissected kidney tubule rna-seq samples from human individuals with and without dkd to infer disease-relevant parameters (figure 7g and data s21).;     multiple linear regression models demonstrated that the wgcna score estimated fibrosis (b = 1.144 p < 0.001) glomerulosclerosis (b = 0.616 p < 0.001) and gfr (b = 0.546 p < 0.001) independent of other clinical variables (data s22).;     ordinal logistic regression showed the wgcna score to independently estimate albuminuria (odds ratio = 1.045 p < 0.001) (data s22) such that a high wgcna score was associated with albuminuria (figure s14e).   the slides were analyzed using a semiquantitative scoring ranging from grade 1 to 5 (grade 1 minimal/very few; grade 2 slight/ few/small; grade 3 moderate; grade 4 marked/many; grade 5 massive).;     <section> of biosample negative control or interplate control samples was analyzed with 3 ml <section> processed data are available via an interactive website (http://www.susztaklab.com/zsf1_sgc_snrna/).","<section> data and code availability d raw and metadata are available at geo accession number gse209821.","<section> code to reproduce all parts of the analysis is deposited in github (https://github.com/ms-balzer/zsf1_sgc/)."

    we generated pearson correlation coefﬁcients between cfhr5 and all other expressed protein coding transcripts (n = 19525) (supplementary data 1 [tab_6 table a]) and used gene ontology (go) and reactome analysis 3940 to identify over-represented classes and pathways in the top 50 most highly correlated genes (supplementary data 1 [tab_6 table b and c]).;     we performed an unbiased weighted network correlation analysis (wgcna) 41 on the same dataset where correlation coefﬁcients between all transcripts excluding those classiﬁed as non-coding were calculated and subsequently clustered into related groups based on expression similarity (supplementary data 1 [tab_6 table a column f]).;     <section> of these 13/18 [72%] were other members of the complement cascade and 15/18 [83%] were also speciﬁcally expressed in liver 36 (supplementary data 1 [tab_6 table a column f]) (supplementary data 1 [tab_6 table a column b bold text]).;     when these proteins were interrogated using the protein-protein interaction database string v.11  13/18 had high conﬁdence functional and physical associations (fig. 2c) (supplementary data 1 [tab_7 table a]).;     cfhr5 was most strongly linked to complement 3 (c3) the central hub of the largest of the three linked cluster groups identiﬁed (fig. 2c clusters represented by green red and cyan) (supplementary data 1 [tab_7 table;     in vebios er plasma c3 was not elevated in cases compared to controls (fig. 2d left and supplementary data 1 [tab_2 panel b]) cfhr5 and c3 did not signiﬁcantly correlate in either group (fig. 2d right panel) and c3 was not associated with vte (or 1.04 [ci 0.68-1.58] p = 0.86) (supplementary data 1 [tab_8]).;

    we sourced three independent replication cohorts to test the association of cfhr5 with vte; the swedish karolinska age adjusted d-dimer study (dfw-vte) vte study (n = 200) consisting of patients with suspected vte (cases; n = 54 controls; n = 146) 44 (fig. 3b) the french farive study (n = 1158) consisting of patients sampled during the week following a diagnosis of acute vte (n = 582) with hospital-based controls (n = 576) 45 (fig. 3c) and the spanish riesgo de enfermedad tromboembólica venosa (retrove) study (n = 668) of patients sampled post anticoagulant treatment (n = 308) with population based controls (n = 360) (fig. 3e) (for all cohort details see supplementary data 2 [tabs_2–4 and 6]).;     these associations remain signiﬁcant in subgroup meta-analyses when stratiﬁed by thrombosis type (dvt or pe) sex or cause (provoked/unprovoked) (supplementary data 1 [tab_9 table a–c]).;     the results were consistent when further adjusting for bmi and/or crp when this information was available (supplementary data 1 [tab_10 table;     <section> cfhr5 and risk of recurrent vte we measured plasma cfhr5 concentration in a sample of 669 vte patients from the marseille thrombosis association study (martha) study that have been followed for vte recurrence among which experienced a recurrent event (supplementary data 2 [tab_5]) after adjusting for sex familial history of vte provoked or unprovoked status of the ﬁrst vte age at ﬁrst vte and bmi the hazard ratio (hr) associated of 1 sd increase in cfhr5 levels was hr = 1.13 [0.96-1.32] p = 0.134.;     <iend> rs10737681–g allele was associated with a marginal (p = 0.016) decreased risk of vte (supplementary data 1 [tab_11]).;     this pattern of association is not consistent with the relationship between increased cfhr5 plasma levels and increased vte risk observed in the present studies since the rs10737681-g cfhr5 increasing allele would have been expected to be associated with increased vte risk (supplementary data 1 [tab_11]).;     interestingly the rs10737681 was also identiﬁed as the lead snp at this locus in the extended meta-analysis (β = 0.28 ± 0.01 p = 2.94e-396) (supplementary data 1 [tab_12]).;     <section> dnah10 (rs7133378 p = 2.43e-08) also on 12q24.31 and hnf4a (rs1800961 p = 4.97e-08) on 20q13.12 (fig. 4a and supplementary data 1 [tab_12]).;     <section> rs2393776 (p = 0.17) demonstrated marginal (p < 0.05) association with vte risk (supplementary data 1 [tab_11]).;     this explains why mendelian randomization (mr) analyses are not supportive for a causal association between increased cfhr5 levels and vte (supplementary data 1 [tab_13]).;     <section> twelve rare variants were found polymorphic at this locus in martha participants (supplementary data 1 [tab_14]).;     see also supplementary data 1 [tabs_11–13].;     <section> patients with previous vte as thrombin generation has been associated with increased risk of vte  we tested the association between cfhr5 plasma concentration and thrombin generation as measured by thrombinoscope in martha (n = 774 vte cases see supplementary data 2 [tab_5] for details) with replication in retrove (308 cases/360 controls see supplementary data 2 [tab_4] for details).;     in both martha and retrove cases we ﬁnd signiﬁcant association between cfhr5 and lag time (⍴ = 0.181 p = p < 0.0001 and ⍴ = 0.176 p < 0.0001 respectively) endogenous thrombin potential (etp) (⍴ = 0.105 p = 0.0036 and ⍴ = 0.130 p < 0.0001 respectively) peak (⍴ = 0.117 p = 0.0012 and ⍴ = 0.132 p < 0.0001) and ttpeak (⍴ = 0.116 p = 0.0012 and ⍴ = 0.086 p = 0.0274) (see supplementary data 1 [tab_15]).;

    analysis conﬁrmed progressed healing in young animals by faster callus progression (fig. 2a b) and higher levels of tissue mineralization (fig. 2c d supplementary data 2).;     lastly fracture callus tissue from young rats showed increased expression levels of the osteogenic genes collagen type i alpha 2 chain (col1a2) at day 3 and 7 and secreted phosphoprotein 1(spp1) (fig. 2e supplementary data 2) at day to validate our hypothesis of the local metabolic environment being a driver of effective bone tissue repair we performed untargeted proteomic screening (lc-ms/ms) of fracture hematoma/callus tissue sampled at days 3 7 and 14 after femoral osteotomy from successful healing and biologically compromised healing respectively.;     the strongest resulting regulation was seen in kegg pathways associated with extracellular matrix and migration metabolism and immune responses (fig. 3a; supplementary data 3 16 17).;     in particular clusters related to sugar metabolism amino acid metabolism and oxidative metabolism were decreased in the group of compromised healing (fig. 3a; supplementary data 3; 16).;     by contrast proteins related to immune response and secondary metabolic pathways were increased in compromised bone healing when compared to successful healing (fig. 3b; supplementary data 3; 17).;     levels of glucose and tca cycle metabolism-associated proteins (e.g. phosphofructokinase (pfkm) isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (idh1)) started to increase in samples showing successful healing at day 7 and were highly increased at day (e.g. isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (idh2) citrate synthase (cs) fig. 4a supplementary data 4).;

supplementary data 11).;     similarly central carbon metabolic enzymes (hexokinase 2 hk2 and succinate dehydrogenase beta sdhb) showed higher expression levels in successful healing samples during early healing time points namely day and day 7 (fig. 4b supplementary data 4).;     metabolic intermediates of the central carbon metabolism (ccm) were identiﬁed using an analytical workﬂow as published by kuich et al. while no signiﬁcant differences in metabolic intermediates between the healing groups were detected at day 3 (fig. 4a) differences in ccm metabolites at metabolic pathway checkpoints (e.g. 3-phosphoglyceric acid (3pg) lactate and succinate) were detected (fig. 5a b supplementary data 5) in day 7 samples.;     it is important to note that glucose levels were comparable between successful and compromised bone healing across all time points measured (fig. 6a supplementary data 6) suggesting no substrate limitations at the beginning of the glycolytic pathway.;     <section> most interestingly succinate levels were increased signiﬁcantly at day 7 in samples from successful healing compared to compromised healing by 3-fold (fig. 6a supplementary data 6).;     similar tendencies were detected for the metabolites glutamate α-ketoglutarate and protein levels of alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (ogdh) suggesting increased glycolytic and tca cycle activity and tca cycle replenishment from glutaminolysis in animals with a successful healing progression (fig. 6a & supplementary ﬁg 2 supplementary data 6 12).;     <section> 3031 gene expression analysis of the succinate receptor in fracture samples showed an increased expression in samples of successful healing at day 7 (fig. 6b supplementary data 6).;     metabolic analysis of serum samples collected at the time of animal sacriﬁce conﬁrmed that there was no systemic regulation of succinate between healing time points in successful or compromised healing (supplementary fig 3 supplementary data 13).;     changes in transcription of m1and m2-like macrophage markers and cytokines upon extracellular stimulation with succinate were analyzed (for differentiation experiments of monocytic cells into macrophage subsets please refer to supplementary fig 4 supplementary data 14).;     addition of succinate to the cultures led to an increase of il-1β expression in m1 versus m2 macrophages (fig. 7a supplementary data 7).;     <section> increased in m1 macrophages upon addition of succinate to the culture (fig. 7b supplementary data 7).;     when freshly isolated human cluster of differentiation 14 positive (cd14 + ) cells were activated with lipopolaysaccharide (lps) and stimulated with 50 µm succinate il-1β secretion was also increased (fig. 7c supplementary data 7).;     tannahill and colleagues showed that intracellular succinate induces mrna expression and hif-1α activity when we investigated in vitro tube formation using human huvecs (hhuvecs) addition of succinate to cultures signiﬁcantly enhanced tube length and network formation (fig. 7d;7 supplementary data 7) under angiogenic culture conditions (+gf;     remarkably extracellular stimulation of succinate (50 µm) also led to increased tube formation in growth factor-free conditions (−gf +fcs) (fig. 7d supplementary data 7) indicating that extracellular succinate can function as an angiogenic factor.;     <section> cells from three independent donors were investigated all showing higher percentages of repopulated scratch area when succinate was added to the culture media (15–20% fig. 7f g supplementary data 7).;     this effect was signiﬁcant for treatments with 50 µm succinate at 15 hours post-scratch and onwards also for treatments with 500 µm succinate from 21 hours post-scratch and onwards (fig. 7h supplementary data 7).;     enzymatic activity of alkaline phosphatase (alp) marker for early osteogenic differentiation was signiﬁcantly increased at day 7 in osteogenic cultures (om) upon addition of succinate to the culture medium in all tested donors (fig. 8a supplementary data 8).;     similarly after 18 days of osteogenic differentiation cultures matrix formation and mineralization were increased when succinate was added to the culture (fig. 8b d supplementary data 8).;     to account for cell division the cell number was determined by hoechst staining and did not show any differences between the treatments (fig. 8c supplementary data 8).;     <section> addition of succinate (500 µm) in vitro particularly induced strong mineralization when the overall mineralization capacity appeared delayed or less pronounced as suggested by observations from donor three (fig. 8c supplementary data 8).;     while constant il-1β (0.1 ng/ml 10 ng/ml) 39 lead to a decreased osteogenic differentiation and premature cell contraction (supplementary fig 5 supplementary data 15) a transient addition of 0.1 ng/ml il-1β (24 h) to hmscs under osteogenic culture conditions led to a signiﬁcant increase of mineralized matrix formation after 18 days (fig. 9 a c supplementary data 9).;     additional supplementation with succinate signiﬁcantly enhanced the formation of matrix even further in out of 3 donors and by trend in 1 additional donor (fig. 9a c supplementary data 9).","",""

    <section> concentrations of arabinose ranging from 0.00001% to 0.2% using ﬂow cytometry (fig. 2b supplementary fig. 1 supplementary data 1).;     a combination of decoupled arabinose transporter-reporter system and deletion of the arabad operon resulted in increased p bad dependent reporter gene expression over a wide range of 0.0005% to 0.2% arabinose (fig. 2b c dark red supplementary fig. 2a dark dashed red supplementary data 1 and 2).;     <section> background in the presence of 0.2% arabinose p proa -controlled expression of arae (p proa -arae) results in slower growth during early exponential growth (fig. 2d red supplementary data 1) compared to native arabinose-dependent arae expression in the wild-type strain (p arae -arae) (fig. 2d grey).;     in presence of 0.05% or lower arabinose concentrations the growth of strains expressing arae from either native p proa or p prod was similar (supplementary fig. 2b supplementary fig. 3a b and c supplementary data 3).;     in high arabinose concentrations (0.1% and 0.2%) the reduced growth of arabad strains + background) expressing arae is compensated from either by native arabad p proa operon or p deletion prod (in (supplementary fig. 2c d e supplementary fig. 3d e f supplementary data 1 and 3).;     the dcas9 binds to a scaffold rna (scrna) which consists of a sequence that targets the j1-derived synthetic promoter the scrna is fused to an ms2 hairpin sequence which recruits an ms2 coating protein (mcp) fused to an r93a mutant of the soxs activator domain which has previously been shown to effectively activate transcription 1721 (fig. 3a supplementary data 4).;     <section> enterica and used p bad to control the expression of the relatively large dcas9 protein as well as the soxs ad to minimize the negative effect of crispr/dcas9-derived atf expression on growth (supplementary fig. 4 supplementary data 5).;     in salmonella crispr/dcas9-derived atfs controlling expression of the ﬂuorescent reporter protein resulted in minimal growth defect (supplementary fig. 6 supplementary data 6) and a high reporter expression after 4 h induction with arabinose (fig. 3b and supplementary data 4 16-fold induction for crispr/dcas9derived atf targeting j105 in m9 minimal medium and supplementary fig. 7 and supplementary data 7 2.5-fold induction for crispr/dcas9-derived atf targeting j105 in lb medium).;     <section> in e. coli a maximum of ~2.7-fold reporter expression was observed for crispr/dcas9-derived atf after 4 h induction with 0.2% arabinose (supplementary fig. 8 and supplementary data 8 crispr/dcas9-derived atf targeting j111).;     therefore we tested the inducible expression of crispr/dcas9-derived atfs after 8 h induction and in the presence of various arabinose concentrations in e. coli resulting in up to 7-fold induction (fig. 3c supplementary data 4).;     <section> therefore we monitored the expression output of the crispr/ dcas9-derived atf targeting j105 in salmonella over 36 h (supplementary fig. 11a supplementary data 9).;     we did not observe a signiﬁcant difference in its induction level in subcultures (supplementary fig. 11b supplementary data 9).;     expression of plant-derived tfs under p bad -control in a high-copy plasmid (see supplementary information) induced with 0.2% arabinose was not sufﬁcient to activate transcription in e. coli (supplementary fig. 13 supplementary data 10).;     <section> tfs to the bacterial soxs(r93a) activation domain and placed it under the control of p bad 1721 (fig. 4a supplementary data 11).;     this is evident in fig. 4b (0.05% arabinose added to the minimal medium and see supplementary data 11) and supplementary fig. 14 (0.2% arabinose added to lb medium and see;     <section> supplementary data 12) and aligns with our previous ﬁndings of the transcription activation capacity of atfs in yeast since we observed similar transcriptional outputs for both plasmidand chromosomally-expressed systems we implemented plasmid-based expression of jub1-derived atf in the following experiments as it may be favorable over genomic integration in some cases due to easier accessibility to manipulation.;     as shown in fig. 4c in the minimal medium the expression of the reporter (atf expression cassette together with reporter cassette harboring corresponding binding site) displayed an inducible range of more than ~29-fold (for jub1-2x) when induced with 0.05% arabinose which is 40% higher than when grown in lb medium supplemented with 0.05% arabinose (supplementary fig. 15 supplementary data 13).;     importantly there was no signiﬁcant correlation between the number of plant tf binding site copies in a given synthetic promoter and basal level of ﬂuorescence expression (supplementary fig. 16 supplementary data 14) probably because the distance of the binding sites to the transcription start site (tss) is out of the effective region to activate gene expression by the soxs ad.;     of note all atfs resulted in higher sfgfp reporter expression than the control strain expressing sfgfp from the constitutive p rpsm promoter (fig. 4c and supplementary data 11 up to ~3.5-fold expression).;     all tested combinations of grf9or anac102derived atfs and their bss resulted in low transcriptional outputs in salmonella (supplementary fig. 17 and supplementary data 15 ~0.4to ~0.6-fold of that observed for the control strain) despite being categorized as medium and strong transcription activators in yeast to further establish a dynamic arabinose-inducible system for precise temporal gene expression control in bacteria we next characterized the jub1-derived atfs together with one two or four copies of the bs in a s. enterica background deleted for the arabad operon (and thus deﬁcient in arabinose catabolism) and constitutivly expressing arabinose transporter (fig. 2b δarabad p arae ::p proa ).;     for the jub1-2x expression/reporter in the optimized salmonella genetic background the addition of 0.05% arabinose resulted in ~1.9-fold induction of the reporter expression compared to constitutive expression and 35-fold induction compared to non-inducing conditions (fig. 4d supplementary data 11) with a minimal growth defect compared to the non-inducing conditions (supplementary fig. 18 supplementary data 16).;     the ﬂuorescent expression output of strong jub1-derived atf targeting two copies of its binding site was stable over 24 h (supplementary fig. 19a supplementary data 17).;     additionally we did not observe a signiﬁcant difference in its induction level after three subcultures (supplementary fig. 19b supplementary data 17).;     we termed this strain salsor 0.1 (salmonella biosensor 0.1 fig. 5a and supplementary data 18).;     therefore we engineered the salsor 0.2 strain which in addition to harboring the synthetic ramr-controlled sfgfp reporter module expresses chromosomally encoded ramr under the control of our above-developed arabinose-inducible jub1-derived atf in combination with a synthetic promoter harboring two copies of the jub1 bs (jub1-2x) (fig. 5b supplementary data 18).;     <section> as shown in fig. 6d (see also supplementary data 19) in the presence of 0.2% arabinose the strain with atf control modules produced ~2.1-fold more β-carotene compared to the strain harboring pk2151201.;     increasing the induction time from 4 h to 8 h led to a ~ 40% increase in β-carotene production in the strain allowing expression of the biosynthetic pathway genes using atf (fig. 6e supplementary fig. 20 supplementary data 19 and 20 atf result jub1 in  pcaroten5x an increased β-carotene 0.2% arabinose). level however in the strain it did with not constitutive operon expression.;     the β-carotene production was stable for at least 12 h (fig. 6e supplementary data 19).","",""

    <section> using both clinically diagnosed ad and ad-by-proxy as the exposure (jansen et al. dataset)  we identiﬁed 8 proteins as potentially affected by ad susceptibility (supplementary data 38 supplementary figs.;

    of these 8 signiﬁcant proteins two (ctsz and fam177a1) were the same as those identiﬁed using clinically diagnosed ad as exposure (kunkle et al. stage dataset) with the same effect direction in the analysis using proxy snps inside of the apoe region 4 of the 8 proteins remained signiﬁcant and none were signiﬁcant using proxy snps outside of the apoe region (ivw mre p > 8.69e-2 supplementary data 38).;     the proxy snps of ad had modest heterogeneity in the pqtl meta-analysis (i2 median (1st 3rd quartile): 0 (0 16.4) supplementary data 30).;     <section> interestingly among the 14 unique protein measures that were signiﬁcantly affected by ad susceptibility using the kunkle et al. <section> or jansen et al. datasets the effects from the mr analysis were in an unexpected direction from their associations with cognitive function in the discovery analysis (supplementary data 40).;     however in our discovery analysis higher levels of these proteins were associated with higher cognitive function (supplementary data 40).;     however in the discovery meta-analysis higher crp levels were associated with lower cognitive function (beta = −0.047 sd p = 2.2e-6 supplementary data 40).;     to further investigate this unexpected direction of effect we evaluated the association between apoe ε4 carrier status and the levels of the 14 proteins implicated to be affected by ad susceptibility given that apoe ε4 has been the genetic locus with the largest effect size on ad and the genetic variants in apoe region were used in the mr analysis based on data from aric and chs among 13 of the 14 proteins the association between the apoe ε4 carrier status and these proteins support the effect direction from the mr analysis (binomial p = 4.0e-3 supplementary data 40).;     a lookup of the catalog of human genome-wide association studies (gwas) on the association between the apoe ε4 variants and crp in large-scale biobank studies conﬁrm that the risk alleles of apoe ε4 variants were associated with lower crp levels consistent with results from mr analysis (supplementary data 41) to gain additional insight into the effect of ad susceptibility on crp levels we used mr analysis to evaluate the effect of ad susceptibility on il6 a regulator of crp expression ad susceptibility overall or from the apoe region did not have signiﬁcant effects on il6 levels as measured by somascan based on bonferroni-corrected threshold (ivw mre genome-wide beta = −0.019 p = 5.7e-2; apoe region beta = −0.024 p = 3.9e-1).;     technical variations of the protein assays were normalized based on manufacturer protocols (supplementary data 2).;     for protein measures quantiﬁed using the somascan platform non-human proteins and proteins that were known to bind to contaminates or related proteins with similar afﬁnity were excluded from the discovery meta-analysis (supplementary data 2).;     the primary outcome was general cognitive function represented by the ﬁrst unrotated principal component (pc1) of cognitive scores from at least three different domains (supplementary data 6).;     this approach has been used by previous gwas for discovering associations between genetic variants and general cognitive function the variance of the cognitive test scores explained by pc1 ranged from 0.47 to 0.67 among discovery and replication cohorts (supplementary data 7).;     the contribution of each cognitive score to pc1 (loading) and the correlation between each cognitive score and pc1 are reported in supplementary data 5 and 6.;     the dsst was used by two discovery cohorts and was included in the generation of general cognitive function in these cohorts (supplementary data 5).;
