    further fasting decreased the frequency of proin?ammatory th17 (cd27bright cd161+ccr6+cxcr3? cd25?cd4+) as well as tnf?- and ifn?-producing th1 cells (fig. 1i supplementary data 1).;     however frequency of pro-in?ammatory maits producing tnf? and ifn? signi?cantly decreased upon fasting and were minimally affected by refeeding (fig. 1i supplementary data 1).;     effect sizes and fdr-corrected p values can be found in supplementary data 12.  period controlling for age sex and any changes in medication (fig. 1fh supplementary data 1).;     fasting stimulated shifts in the abundance of several core commensals which were reversed upon refeeding (fig. 1f supplementary data 1).;     these shifts were accompanied by vast changes in microbial metabolic capacity (fig. 1g supplementary data 1).;     further 4  subjects undergoing fasting could signi?cantly (?2 p = 0.035) reduce their intake of antihypertensive medication in 43% of cases compared to only 17% of the cases on dash alone while their bp remained under control (fig. 2b supplementary data 3).;     although all fasting+dash participants showed a reduction in body weight this reduction alone could not explain the long-term ambulatory sbp and map changes exclusive to the fasting arm (fig. 2f g) nor the microbiome or immunome changes accompanying it. 95% of signi?cant ?ndings retain signi?cance when bmi is added as a predictor to the nested models for longitudinal data (see supplementary data 5).;     because the bp responsiveness was heterogeneous in the fasting+dash arm (fig. 2ac) despite the similar disease severity indicated by the baseline clinical characteristics of these patients (supplementary data 6) we hypothesized that unique characteristics involving the immunome or microbiome of these patients may contribute to their bp response.;     we compared the impact of fasting and refeeding in the complete fasting arm in the bp responders of the fasting arm and in the dash-only arm (fig. 4a b supplementary data 2 7 8).;     even at reduced statistical power we were able to capture changes in the abundance of many gut microbial taxa that were uniquely characteristic of successful fasting treatment even 3 months post-fasting (fig. 4a supplementary data 7 8).;     some modules were signi?cantly altered in abundance only in this strati?ed subgroup indicating these changes strongly characterize bp responders compared to non-responders (supplementary data 7).;     changes to the immunome of responders are similar to those seen in the unstrati?ed fasting group and differ from those in the dash arm (fig. 4d supplementary data 2 7 8).;     we assessed all triplets of pairwise interactions between host clinical phenotypes immune cell populations and microbiome taxa or functional pro?les respectively using modi?ed spearman correlations (requiring fdr < 0.1 in each comparison of two data spaces and p < 0.05 in a post-hoc test accounting for the presence of the same subjects at all three time points (see methods supplementary data 9).;     we identi?ed a cluster of circulating cytokine-producing mait cells (absolute number and fraction of cd3+ t cells) which positively correlated with 24 h ambulatory sbp (figs. 5a 6c supplementary fig. 8) and map but not with 24 h diastolic bp (fig. 5a supplementary data 9).;     these immune clusters showed signi?cant interconnection to a remarkable number of microbial scfa producers (fig. 5a b supplementary data 10) though some are rather poorly characterized.;     while further characterization of these taxa in the context of the gut microbiome is needed previously published data indicated that these taxa can produce acetate and likely butyrate and propionate as well (supplementary data 10).;     abundance of kegg module m00209 (osmoprotectant transport system) reported to facilitate the uptake of nutrients mostly found in red meat1618 was negatively associated with ifn?+ and tnf?+ mait cells (fig. 5a b supplementary data 9).;     interestingly fasting depleted various cytokineproducing mait cells with the most pronounced long-lasting decrease seen in il-2+tnf?+ producing mait in bp responders (figs. 5a b 6a supplementary data 9).;     interestingly in our study circulating non-classical monocytes were enriched upon fasting and then depleted again upon refeeding to remain below baseline levels 3 months after fasting (figs. 1h 5a supplementary data 2).;     network analysis revealed an association between non-classical monocytes map and gut abundance of sutterella showed an inverse correlation with non-classical monocytes (figs. 5a b 6d supplementary data 9).;     we compared the results to ours collapsing species/otu fasting/refeeding/long-term follow-up signals in either dataset at the genus level for clarity (fig. 8b supplementary data 11).;     we classi?ed the mesnage patients according to their bp decrease 3 months postfasting (supplementary data 12).;     although these interventions led to bene?cial clinical outcomes their effect on the gut microbiome was highly variable1023242627 (more information in supplementary data 13).;     each of the aforementioned studies are described in greater detail in supplementary data 13.;     however neither the change in bp nor global changes to the microbial composition or immunome appeared to be mediated by this bmi decrease (95% of ?ndings retained signi?cance when deconfounded for bmi change see supplementary data 5 and body weight reduction was not more pervasive in treatment responders than non-  nature communications | (2021)12:1970 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-22097-0 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications  9   article  nature communications | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-22097-0  sp  ro  ide  rth  ell  se  gg  er  th  rre al en occ arasa fm ta us n ot [r an guin u gin is ef v2 osu [re mo ah f m tu s [re ath ot v2 141 f e 0] wa mo u eub 0 yi [r v t acte 2 u v 01642] ef m rium 2 0 44 ot recta ] 6 u 8 le [r v2 dore ef m 088 7] a lon otu gicate mf010 2] 9: glycer v2 1 na [re ol degr 416 f mo adation ] tu v 2 420 (glycero m00725: ca 3] tionic antimicro l kinase pathway bial peptide resistance dlta ) bcd operon m00395: decapping complex toc  nga  tell  study e?ect  tem t transport sys m syste rt o sp an stem litol tr ry sy tes tive xy to ta u la p o u 91: ary t reg m005 euk onen se omp tpa two-c pe a ctd ty -d tb f c 8: 4: d 015 0050 m0  db  +  keg  gm-c  cd  t  )  it f? + ma  -1  7a %  % +  3  cd  7a tnf + ? m  3+  (?l)  % mait +  cd3  il-1  t  ai  +  it  ma  atn  -2 + il  m  +  17  4 + cd  sf + il  +  f? tn  n? a if  il-  a - cd  -c  f? tn  +  ?  il-17  il  il-17  3+ gm  +  (? l)  m  f tn  -2 + %  4+ cd  n? if  ai  l (?  ifn  +  + ++ low r cd16 cd14 cd16 % of hla-d cd14low cd16++ hla-dr+ (?l) cd14low cd16++ hla-dr+ %  sf + il  m  -2  na  p  moprotectan  +  p  ma  m00209: os  ?  n.s.;     upon fasting several clostridial firmicutes shifted signi?cantly in abundance with an initial decrease in butyrate producers such as f. prausnitzii e. rectale and c. comes which were reverted after 3 months upon refeeding; with the latter taxon likely being an indirect effect of the observed weight reduction (supplementary data 5).;     moreover guevara-cruz et al. recently showed in a mexican cohort involving 146 mets patients that a 75 day long 500 kcal/day low-saturated fat dietary intervention improved the clinical phenotype signi?cantly decreased gut dysbiosis and increased the abundance of akkermansia muciniphila and scfa producer f. parusnitzii27 (supplementary data 13).;     remarkably no signi?cant difference in baseline bp bmi lipid levels or glucose homeostasis parameters between bp responders and non-responders was observed before the intervention (supplementary data 6).;     notably a recent study demonstrated that higher baseline akkermansia abundance was associated with persistent weight loss in a study investigating mets/ obese patients undergoing a 52-week long weight reduction program10 (supplementary data 13).;     in addition velikonja et al. showed in a study investigating the effect of beta-glucan supplementation in mets patients that a higher baseline abundance of akkermansia muciniphila and bi?dobacter spp. was characteristic of patients whose cholesterol decreased due to the intervention23 (supplementary data 13).;

    in other words the agreement between both platforms was higher for a genetically de?ned subgroup of participants with effects in cis possibly pointing to epitope effects whereas effects in trans pointing towards posttranslational modi?cations such as glycosylation (supplementary data 10 and supplementary note 1).;     we identi?ed shared genetic signals for a total of 547 protein targetphenotype pairs (posterior probability >80%) comprising 112 protein targets and 342 phenotypes (supplementary data 11).;     source data can be found in supplementary data 2. b importance measures derived from a random-forestbased variable selection procedure to predict spearman correlation coef?cients across all 871 protein targets including technical factors and protein characteristics.;     statistical colocalisation provided strong evidence of a genetic signal shared between all three different protein measures and alzheimers disease (supplementary data 11 and fig. 5a) in line with the a-allele of rs1859788 having been identi?ed as protective for alzheimers disease22.;     4  we identi?ed similar examples with possible downstream consequences for phenotypic interpretation including hepatomaderived growth factor and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations or intracellular adhesion molecule 1 and lymphocyte cell count (supplementary data 11).;     the lead cis-pqtl rs6451229 (maf = 40.1%) for the somascan assay colocalised with type 1 diabetes and treatment for hypothyroidism whereas the lead cispqtl rs11742270 (maf = 26.8%) for the olink assay colocalised with multiple sclerosis allergic disease primary biliary cirrhosis and basophil counts (supplementary data 11).;

    we note that possibly both cis-pqtls for fcgr2a relate to ra since we obtained evidence that the lead signal for somascan colocalised with ra (pp > 87.1%) as assessed in biobank japan (supplementary data 11).;     this shape-based nature enabled us to discover multiple unique proteinphenotype links including cathepsin h and type 1 diabetes (rs2289702 within ctsh) trem-like transcript 2 protein and monocyte count (rs62396355 within treml2) or plexin-b2 and systolic blood pressure (rs28379706 within plxnb2) (supplementary data 11).;     we report 34 cis-pqtls unique to the olink assay and identi?ed in only 485 samples that showed strong evidence for colocalisation with phenotypic traits (pp > 80%) (supplementary data 11).;     each node is either a protein target (square) or a phenotype (circle) and a connection was drawn between both if the protein target shared a genetic signal (posterior probability (pp) >80%) with the phenotype within a 500 kb region around the protein-encoding gene (supplementary data 11).;     a common pattern among results not shared between both assays related to the reliance of the somascan assay to a conserved protein structure to enable aptamer binding (supplementary data 10).;     participants were recruited from general practice surgeries in the cambridgeshire region of the uk and underwent detailed phenotyping at a baseline visit between 2005 and 2015 (supplementary data 1).;     demographics of the subcohort were identical to the overall cohort (supplementary data 1).;     this procedure yielded 937 unique somamerolink measurement pairs comprising 871 unique protein targets (fig. 1 and supplementary data 1).;     this procedure resulted in 479 (n = 333 in cis n = 146 trans 390 protein targets supplementary data 5) genomic regionprotein target combinations for which we had suf?cient statistical power to replicate effects that is pqtls observed in the larger somascan study that had at least a p value < 10?5 when restricting the analysis to the sample of 485 participants with overlapping measurements (see methods).;
