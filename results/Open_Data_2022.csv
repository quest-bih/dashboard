(2021) successfully applied federated learning techniques on data from 20 institutes across the globe to predict the future oxygen requirements of symptomatic patients with covid-19 based on patients’ vital signs laboratory data and chest x-rays [26]. their modelling approach improved generalizability and outperformed models that were trained at a single site using that site’s data. the availability of multi-center data and triangulation of data from different sources (imagery text-based data claims data omics data behavioral and environmental data among others) may be the recipe missing as discussed of current approaches towards precision dentistry. in addition calls for an active opt-out of data sharing and the implementation of broad consent concepts or options for efficient data donation have been raised allowing to establish public datasets which could be used to benchmark prediction models.","","","","10.1007/s00784-022-04420-1"

acute myeloid leukemia with at least one cycle of intensive induction therapy (ara-c (100 mg/m ) for 7 d and daunorubicin (60 mg/m ) for 3 d (‘‘7+3 regimen’’)). bone marrow biopsies and aspirates were obtained according to the hospital’s standard procedure. mononuclear cells from pretherapeutic aml bone marrow were purified by ficoll–hypaque gradient centrifugation (pancoll human pan biotech) and cryopreserved at the institutional biobank (uct frankfurt germany). patient samples with aml blast purity >75% (as assessed by flow cytometry cd45 dim /ssc low blast gate) after ficoll purification were included in this study. the median blast count after ficoll enrichment was 84%. at the university hospital frankfurt patients are routinely advised to undergo a bone marrow biopsy at diagnosis at day-15 of the induction therapy and after completion of induction therapy for response assessment. eligible patients with day-15 blasts >5% no complete remission after induction therapy adverse risk

guidelines (döhner et al. 2017). purified mononuclear cells (purity >75%) and clinical data from patients of the validation cohort (n = 75) were obtained from the biobank of the study alliance

patients included in this cohort were treated for newly diagnosed aml between 1997 and 2009 as explained above. all patients consented to the scientific analysis of their data and biomaterial that was obtained for diagnostic purposes. first complete remission (cr1) was defined as bone marrow blast count < 5% and absence of circulating blasts and blasts with auer rods 45 days after the last induction cycle with or without residual neutropenia (<1.0 3 /l [1000/ml]) or thrombocytopenia (<100 3 /l [100 000/ml]). relapse-free survival (rfs) and remission duration were calculated only for patients that achieved complete remission (cr). data availability is shown in figure s1. demographic and diagnostic variables were ascertained at the time of diagnosis by the university hospital frankfurt and additional trial centers of the sal. the variables collected included: age at diagnosis gender karyotype cytogenetic risk genetic risk according to the european leukemianet (eln)

    all 4 variables (age sex apoe status bmi) related to csf panel biomarker levels in a markerspecific manner (data s1 at2) and were consequently tested as potential covariates in following analyses.;     the routine ad biomarkers and their ratios preclinical alzheimer’s cognitive composite (pacc5) scores and braak roi structural imaging scores differed strongly between the screening diagnosis groups always separating mci and dat subjects from the hc scd and relatives’ groups (data s1 at1).;     within the experimental biomarker panel only fabp-3 showed elevation in dat subjects compared to all other groups after correction for multiple testing (details provided in data s1 at3 and af1).;     all markers that had significant changes in a/t after multiple testing correction showed the same effect in a/n (data s1 at4 and af2).;     these findings were mirrored when using the cognitive staging plus n schematic with elevation of markers in any n+ group against the n groups (data s1 at5 and af3).;     bivariate spearman correlation matrices revealed a high degree of correlation between the experimental panel markers to each other and to the csf routine ad markers (data s1 af4).;     overall these correlations were robust against adjustment for age sex apoe status and bmi (data s1 af5) and were highly comparable to other cohorts in which we analyzed interrelations of similar marker panels (brosseron et al. 2018 2019).;     when limiting the sample to cognitively unimpaired individuals these findings were largely confirmed (data s1 at6).;     further results for other significantly altered markers are displayed in data s1 (at6) and figure s3.;     model i used all available delcode data adjusted for age and sex (data s1 at7).;     lastly model ii was run again excluding the mci and dat subjects from delcode (data s1 at8).;     the association of styro3 to braak v structure remained significant after correction for multiple testing (data s1 at9).;     <iend> and v and of apoe to braak rois iv and v remained significant after correction for multiple testing (data s1 at10).;     repeating the analysis in cn individuals (excluding mci and dat subjects; data s1 at11) did not result in significant associations.;     in contrast exclusion of snap subjects (any a t+ or a n+ subjects) from the whole cohort led to significant results for apoe at follow-up for styro3 at baseline and for saxl at both baseline and follow-up after correction for multiple testing with trend-level findings for all three markers at both baseline and follow-up (data s1 at12).;     these groups did not differ by distribution of sex or bmi but mci subjects had higher median age and a larger proportion of apoe ε4 carriers (data s1 at13).;     of these 9 markers between the mci and scd groups of f.ace only styro3 showed a tendency toward elevation in mci (p = 0.044 [not adjusted for multiple testing]; data s1 at13).;     in contrast application of the a/t scheme to the f.ace data was consistent with the results from delcode where all of the 9 included markers showed highly significant elevation in t+ subjects (data s1 at14 and af6).;     for saxl and mif levels were also elevated for scd t+ against mci t or scd t  despite the limited sample size (data s1 at15 and af7).;     these results were highly significant for all 9 markers replicating delcode results (data s1 at16 at17 af8 and af9).;     bivariate spearman correlations showed again positive correlations of saxl and styro3 throughout braak rois i–v and for apoe and c1q with braak rois iii–v (data s1 at18).;     most of these correlations persisted when excluding all snap (a t+ or a n+) subjects from the f.ace data (data s1 at19).;     gams showed similar results for most braak rois for saxl and styro3 at trend level while the results for styro3 passed multiple testing correction for braak iii and v in both models (data s1 at20 and at21).;     a summary of the braak roi analysis in f.ace is visualized in data s1 af10.;     however when excluding snap subjects from the f.ace data this association of saxl with higher baseline cognitive performance withstood correction for multiple testing (data s1 at22 and at23 respectively).;

fig. 1c). to classify the remainder of cells with no immunolabeling information we applied a ml approach where the electrophysiological features of cells with known labeling were used to train classifiers in order to assign nonlabeled cells to 1 of our 3 cell classes based on their electrophysiological properties (see materials and methods table 1; for electrophysiological properties of the 3 cell classes see table 2). a small fraction of cells (n = 27) was excluded due to ambiguous classification. thus we were able to establish a connectivity scheme between these main subgroups of neurons in the pas (fig. 1d–e). for all connections where the presynaptic cell was classified in 1 of the 2 interneuron classes ipsps were seen in the postsynaptic cell leading us to believe that our classification could robustly separate excitatory and inhibitory neurons. pyramidal neurons form the biggest cell class in the pas. we observed a connectivity rate of 4% between cells of this class (25/622 tested connections; fig 1d). reciprocal connections were observed between 3 separate pairs of pyramidal neurons (3/311 pairs tested 0.96%). this observed frequency is higher than expected based on a 4% connectivity rate (expected likelihood of reciprocal connectivity: 4% × 4% = 0.16% p = 0.014 binomial test) suggesting a nonrandom organization of connectivity between pyramidal neurons in the pas. we found connections between both classes of inhibitory neurons and the pyramidal class of cells. specifically non-fastspiking interneurons connected onto pyramidal neurons at a rate of 13% (5/38 tested connections) whereas fast-spiking neurons showed a 44% connectivity rate onto pyramidal neurons (17/39 tested connections). in the opposite direction pyramidal neurons contacted non-fast-spiking neurons at a relatively low rate (2.6% 1/38 test connections unidirectional) but contacted fast-spiking neurons at a rate of 23% (9/39 tested connections). between pyramidal and fast-spiking neurons 5 reciprocally connected pairs were found (5/39 pairs 12.8%). given the individual connectivity rates between these 2 cell classes the number of reciprocal pairs found was not different from expected (expected likelihood of reciprocal connectivity: 44% × 23% = 10.1% p = 0.591 binomial test).","<section> data and software availability code availability code used for the analysis of electrophysiology and cell classification can be found on github under https://github.com/rosa nnaps/pas-analysis.git results connectivity scheme between the major cell classes in the pas we recorded simultaneously from up to 6 neurons (1 sextuple 7 quintuple 13 quadruple 47 triple and 101 double recordings) in a whole-cell patch-clamp configuration in the pas to elucidate the microcircuitry within this region (fig. 1a).","<section> data and software availability code availability code used for the analysis of electrophysiology and cell classification can be found on github under https://github.com/rosa nnaps/pas-analysis.git results connectivity scheme between the major cell classes in the pas we recorded simultaneously from up to 6 neurons (1 sextuple 7 quintuple 13 quadruple 47 triple and 101 double recordings) in a whole-cell patch-clamp configuration in the pas to elucidate the microcircuitry within this region (fig. 1a). the pas was identified in acute slices based on the size and organization of cell somata;

for electrophysiological properties of the 3 cell classes see table 2). a small fraction of cells (n = 27) was excluded due to ambiguous classification. thus we were able to establish a connectivity scheme between these main subgroups of neurons in the pas (fig. 1d–e). for all connections where the presynaptic cell was classified in 1 of the 2 interneuron classes ipsps were seen in the postsynaptic cell leading us to believe that our classification could robustly separate excitatory and inhibitory neurons. pyramidal neurons form the biggest cell class in the pas. we observed a connectivity rate of 4% between cells of this class (25/622 tested connections; fig 1d). reciprocal connections were observed between 3 separate pairs of pyramidal neurons (3/311 pairs tested 0.96%). this observed frequency is higher than expected based on a 4% connectivity rate (expected likelihood of reciprocal connectivity: 4% × 4% = 0.16% p = 0.014 binomial test) suggesting a nonrandom organization of connectivity between pyramidal neurons in the pas. we found connections between both classes of inhibitory neurons and the pyramidal class of cells. specifically non-fastspiking interneurons connected onto pyramidal neurons at a rate of 13% (5/38 tested connections) whereas fast-spiking neurons showed a 44% connectivity rate onto pyramidal neurons (17/39 tested connections). in the opposite direction pyramidal neurons contacted non-fast-spiking neurons at a relatively low rate (2.6% 1/38 test connections unidirectional) but contacted fast-spiking neurons at a rate of 23% (9/39 tested connections). between pyramidal and fast-spiking neurons 5 reciprocally connected pairs were found (5/39 pairs 12.8%). given the individual connectivity rates between these 2 cell classes the number of reciprocal pairs found was not different from expected (expected likelihood of reciprocal connectivity: 44% × 23% = 10.1% p = 0.591 binomial test).","<section> data and software availability code availability code used for the analysis of electrophysiology and cell classification can be found on github under https://github.com/rosa nnaps/pas-analysis.git results connectivity scheme between the major cell classes in the pas we recorded simultaneously from up to 6 neurons (1 sextuple 7 quintuple 13 quadruple 47 triple and 101 double recordings) in a whole-cell patch-clamp configuration in the pas to elucidate the microcircuitry within this region (fig. 1a).;
