### How to assess FAIR?

<font size="3">The FAIRness (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, Reproducibility) of research data objects can be evaluated by automatic tools that aggregate metadata embedded in the data (landing) page or retrieved from other services (e.g. [DataCite content negotiation](https://support.datacite.org/docs/datacite-content-resolver) or [re3data](https://www.re3data.org)).

We used [F‑UJI](https://www.f-uji.net/index.php?action=home) to assess research data objects mentioned in publications by Charité authors from 2021. F‑UJI uses [16 metrics](https://zenodo.org/record/4081213#.Yi8yWC8w1pQ) that are derived from the [FAIRsFAIR project](https://www.fairsfair.eu) to assess 12 (out of 15) FAIR principles.

As FAIR principles are abstract and generically defined F‑UJI specifies one or more metrics for each assessed FAIR principle. Since each metric can be tested in various ways depending on data contexts and current best practises F‑UJI additionally uses one or more practical tests to evaluate datasets against a particular metric (click on the chart to see the metrics).

Based on the weighted metrics (the weight is represented by the size of the chart wedges), the FAIRness of a research data object can be calculated.</font>

<!---The FAIRness (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, Reproducibility) of research data objects can be evaluated by automatic tools that aggregate metadata embedded in the data (landing) page or retrieved from a persistent identifier provider (e.g. [DataCite content negotiation](https://support.datacite.org/docs/datacite-content-resolver)) and other services (e.g. [re3data](https://www.re3data.org)).-->

<!---For example, FAIR principle 'F1 — (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier)' is evaluated by the two metrics 'FsF-F1-01D — (Data is assigned a globally unique identifier)' and 'FsF-F1-02D — (Data is assigned a persistent identifier)', which in turn can be assigned one or more practical tests such as 'Identifier is resolvable and follows a defined unique identifier syntax (IRI, URL)'.--> 

<!---In order for a research data object to be reused, it — and the hosting data repository — must meet certain quality criteria that ensure it is <a href = 'https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/'>FAIR — Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable</a>.For this purpose the data must be stored together with detailed metadata that must conform to a defined standard.In addition, datasets are easier to reuse if the corresponding metadata is machine-readable and uses a standardized vocabulary.-->
